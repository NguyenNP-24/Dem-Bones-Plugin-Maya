# 🦴 DemBones Maya Plugin

A Maya plugin that converts mesh or simulation animation into clean joint-based animation using the **DemBones** algorithm — integrated from the open-source project [DemBones by Electronic Arts](https://github.com/electronicarts/dem-bones).

This plugin builds `.mll` files for multiple Maya versions (2018–2025), allowing native integration and high-performance decomposition directly inside Maya.
